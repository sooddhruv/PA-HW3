## Feature Selection and Data Classification Assignment



Objective
The primary objective of this task is to apply data mining techniques to the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Public-Use Data to predict the survivability rate of
breast cancer patients. This involves developing a predictive model that can accurately
classify patients into survivability outcomes based on a set of features derived from the
SEER database. This assignment will provide you with hands-on experience in using
feature selection and classification algorithms for predictive analytics. By the end of this
assignment, you should be able to â€“

1. Perform data cleaning, validating and preprocessing
2. Apply Feature Selection and Feature Ranking
3. Benchmark various algorithms
4. Perform hyperparameter searches
5. Maintain clean and understandable code
